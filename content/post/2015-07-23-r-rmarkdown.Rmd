# 1.Abstract

This dataset is about the crime rate from 2014 to 2019 by Neighborhood in Toronto. It counts six major crimes including Assault, Auto Theft, Break and Enter, Robbery, Theft Over, and Homicide. In this dataset, we investigate five years of crime rate for each crime type by Neighborhood. Also, this dataset contains the average crime rate amount of five years and crime rates per 100,000 people by neighborhood based on the 2016 Census Population.

## 2.data Introduction
Neighbourhood	 is the name of City of Toronto neighbourhood.

Hood_ID	 is  the City of Toronto neighbourhood identifier.

Population	is 2016 Census Population.

Assault_(year)	is the Count of assaults for that year.

For example, Assault_2015	 is Count of assaults for 2015.

Assault_AVG	is Average Assaults from 2014 - 2019.

Assault_CHG	is the percent Change in assaults from 2018-2019.

Assault_Rate_2019	is the Rate of assaults for 2019 per 100,000 population.

AutoTheft_(year)	is Count of auto thefts for that year.

Shape__Area	is the Autogenerated area measurement.

Shape__Length	is the Autogenerated length measurement.

we use @citedatafeature.

This dataset is about the crime rate from 2014 to 2019 by Neighborhood in Toronto., and the dataset is refreshed annually. It counts six major crimes including Assault, Auto Theft, Break and Enter, Robbery, Theft Over, and Homicide.  
In this case, we investigate mainly on the average assault incidents from 2014 to 2019 by neighborhood.Also, we will study the relationship between the populations and average assault incidents.
To visualize this statistic study, we will use scatterplot, histogram, boxplot, and barplot to shoe our finding directly.

we use @citetidyverse.

# 5.Including Plots


```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap=' Poplation (2016 Census) vs avgerage Assault incidents(2014-2019) by neighborhood', tidy=FALSE}
ggplot(data=data, aes(x=Population, y=Assault_AVG)) + geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```
From the scatterplot above,there exists a positive linear relationship between the populations and average assault incidents by neighborhood. This relation is strong.




```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap=' # of Neighborhoods that have the similar avgerage Assault incidents(2014-2019)', tidy=FALSE}

ggplot(data=data, aes(x=Assault_AVG)) + geom_histogram(color="black",fill="blue",bins= 40)
```

From the above histogram plot, the Distribution is Right-skewed.In this case, the median is less than the mean of the average assault incidents.Most Neighborhoods average assault incidents is lower than 250.


```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap=' boxplot of avgerage Assault incidents(2014-2019)', tidy=FALSE}
ggplot(data=data, aes(x='',y=Assault_AVG)) + geom_boxplot(color="grey",fill="pink")+coord_flip()
```

From the above boxplot,there are some outliers.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap=' bar plot of avgerage Assault incidents(2014-2019)', tidy=FALSE}

ggplot(data=data, aes(x=Assault_AVG)) + geom_bar(color="red")
```

From the above barplot,the avgerage Assault incidents frequently happen when the number is less than 200.



# 6.graph discussion 

Even though there exist some outliers,  the number of most neighborhoods' average assault incidents is less than 250.
Also, the relationship between the populations baesd on2016 Census  and average assault incidents from 2014 to 2019 by neighborhood is  positive, linear,and strong.
